        <h4>Website release! <span class="text-sm">May 1st, 2020</span></h4>

        <p>To build the entire static website, took me about three hours in total. Mainly, I was working in the backend
        side as usual. As, I am trying to implement a basic Content Management System. As for initial release, the blog
        will remain static. Until I figure out how to implement a WYIWG editor and a safer way in restricting into admin
        side of the website.</p>

        <p>The whole purporse of the website, was mainly see if I am familiar enough with the Laravel framework. I must
        say I am fairly confident, and having a lot of fun with it. But it does mean, that I will be transition, more to
        Backend/DevOps and potentially learning Go Lang and Rust for the entire month May.</p>
